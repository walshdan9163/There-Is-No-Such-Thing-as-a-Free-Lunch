## What is it?
'There is No Such Thing as a Free Lunch' is a way to divide group bills into what each individual owes.

Its primary use-case and inspiration is to easily determine how much money each individual owes when one member of a group pays for a group order. There are always fees, tips and taxes that apply to the overall bill in a group order, and this is a way to easily divide that among the participants.

## How does it work?
Simply input the Tip and Fees amount, decide if you would like to *prorate, and add each participants name and meal cost.

Finally, press 'calculate' which will then populate the Meal Cost fields with the full amount that the participants owes - tax, fees and tip included.

## Technologies involed:
React.js, Node.js, Express and Bootstrap for styling.
